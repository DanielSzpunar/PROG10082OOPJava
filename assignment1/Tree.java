* Assignment: Assignment #1.2
* Submitted by: Daniel Szpunar / Sheridan ID #991502498
* Program: Computer Programming
* File name: Tree.java
* 
* Description: This is a simple java program that prints an 
* image of a pinetree to the console / terminal. To execute 
* this program you must have the JRE installed on your computer. 
* Go to the directory in your terminal where you have saved this 
* file, type: "javac Tree.java" in your terminal to create a 
* Tree.class file. Next, type: "java Tree" to excute the
* program and display the output in your terminal.  
*/

public class Tree {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
/*
* The System class uses the println method which outputs an image
* of a tree to the console.
*/      
      
      System.out.println("   /\\");
      System.out.println("  /  \\");
      System.out.println(" /    \\");
      System.out.println("/      \\");
      System.out.println("--------");
      System.out.println("  \" \"");
      System.out.println("  \" \"");
      System.out.println("  \" \"");      

/*
* Below is a variation of the original assignment which
* uses the System class once instead of multiple times. We can achieve this by using
* the "\n" which creates a new line and concatenation. It remains commented out 
* since it was not part of the original assignment.  Remove comments to 
* execute the code.
